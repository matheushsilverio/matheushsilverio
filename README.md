# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Matheus SilvÃ©rio

I'm a **full-stack software engineer** and entrepreneur. Over the years, I've been building **startups from scratch**, handling **product, technology, and business**. I've founded companies, faced challenges, learned from failures, and kept moving forward. If there's one thing I do well, it's **turning ideas into real, scalable products**.  

## ðŸš€ My journey
- **Escala10**: My first startup, where I learned everything about product development, tech leadership, and market challenges.  
- **EzyLevers**: Built an eSports training platform as CEO and full-stack dev, handling both tech and growth strategy.  
- **G4 EducaÃ§Ã£o**: Developed scalable solutions and led AI projects for business education.  
- **Bernhoeft**: Focused on SaaS, security, and risk management using a serverless architecture.  

## ðŸ’¡ What am I good at?
- Building **scalable products** from the ground up.  
- Structuring **startups from the first steps**.  
- Designing **robust and efficient architectures**.  
- Working with **cloud computing (AWS/GCP)**.  
- Bridging **technology and business** for fast and sustainable growth.

## ðŸ“¦ Useful Templates
